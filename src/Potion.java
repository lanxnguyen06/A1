     * 1. Trigger CauldronEvent — if it explodes, the potion is ruined.
     * 2. Otherwise, check its strength & quality:
     *    If the strength is greater than 15 and the quality is greater than 3, it is brewed perfectly
     *    If the potion is not ruined and its strength is less than 15 but greater than
     *      10 and the quality is greater than 3, the potion is a bit unstable but ok
     *    Otherwise, the potion is ruined.
